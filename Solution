In this project Customer-segmentation-analysis-to-improve-conversion.
There are two datasets named "TRANSACTION_LINE.csv" and "USER_DATA.csv" 

• TRANSACTION_LINE.csv contains various details related to credit accounts of users- it provides a detailed 
record of credit-related transactions and account information,facilitating analysis and credit related decision-
making processes for financial institutions.

• USER_DATA.csv serves as a repository for Apex USER.It typically indcludes essential information about users.

Task 1: Data Cleaning and Importing  
• handling missing values-
In "USER_DATA.csv" dataset ,two columns have  completely missing values named "PHONE_NUMBER" and "ADDRESS".
BY USING SQL, drop two columns -
<!--ATLER TABLE USER_DATA
DROP COLUMN PHONE_NUMBER and ADDRESS.-->
• After removing the two columns, reimport both datasets into your database.
Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

1-Summary of active vs closed accounts.
Active Accounts:
•In active accounts, there will be missing column "closed date" while in closed account,closed date column will be listed there.
•The number of active accounts is represented by the variable "X".
•These are accounts that are currently operational and being used by user till now.
Closed Accounts:
•IN case of closed account, account_balance column "closed date" is mentioned there.

•The number of active accounts is represented by the variable "Y";
•These are accounts that have been terminated or are no longer in use.

2- Breakdown of account_types (e.g.,loans,credit cards) and their current balances.
SELECT
    tl.sactioned_amount,
    tl.account_balance,
    tl.highest_credit,
    tl.account_category
FROM
    "TRANSACTION_LINE" tl
GROUP BY
    tl.account_category,1,2,3;
3- Analysis of loan amounts vs account balances.
•Loan Amount is always greater than account balance for every  in account ,if that account doesn't have already some amount. 
•analysis through loan amounts vs account balance-
SELECT 
MAX(CASE WHEN ownership_type='Joint Account' AND account_category='Two-Wheeler Loan' THEN sactioned_amount-account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Joint_account_two_wheeler_loan,
  MAX(CASE WHEN ownership_type = 'Individual' AND account_category = 'Gold Loan' THEN sactioned_amount - account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Individual_Gold_Loan,
    MAX(CASE WHEN account_category = 'Credit Card' THEN sactioned_amount - account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Credit_Card,
    MAX(CASE WHEN account_category = 'Personal Loan' THEN sactioned_amount - account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Personal_Loan,
    MAX(CASE WHEN account_category = 'Housing Loan' THEN sactioned_amount - account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Housing_Loan,
    MAX(CASE WHEN account_category = 'Auto Loan' THEN sactioned_amount - account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Auto_Loan,
    MAX(CASE WHEN account_category = 'Consumer Loan' THEN sactioned_amount - account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Consumer_Loan
FROM "TRANSACTION_LINE";
