In this project Customer-segmentation-analysis-to-improve-conversion.
There are two datasets named "TRANSACTION_LINE.csv" and "USER_DATA.csv" 

• TRANSACTION_LINE.csv contains various details related to credit accounts of users- it provides a detailed 
record of credit-related transactions and account information,facilitating analysis and credit related decision-
making processes for financial institutions.

• USER_DATA.csv serves as a repository for Apex USER.It typically indcludes essential information about users.

Task 1: Data Cleaning and Importing  
• handling missing values-
In "USER_DATA.csv" dataset ,two columns have  completely missing values named "PHONE_NUMBER" and "ADDRESS".
BY USING SQL, drop two columns -
<!--ATLER TABLE USER_DATA
DROP COLUMN PHONE_NUMBER and ADDRESS.-->
• After removing the two columns, reimport both datasets into your database.
