In this project Customer-segmentation-analysis-to-improve-conversion.
There are two datasets named "TRANSACTION_LINE.csv" and "USER_DATA.csv" 

• TRANSACTION_LINE.csv contains various details related to credit accounts of users- it provides a detailed 
record of credit-related transactions and account information,facilitating analysis and credit related decision-
making processes for financial institutions.

• USER_DATA.csv serves as a repository for Apex USER.It typically indcludes essential information about users.

Task 1: Data Cleaning and Importing  
• handling missing values-
In "USER_DATA.csv" dataset ,two columns have  completely missing values named "PHONE_NUMBER" and "ADDRESS".
BY USING SQL, drop two columns -
<!--ATLER TABLE USER_DATA
DROP COLUMN PHONE_NUMBER and ADDRESS.-->
• After removing the two columns, reimport both datasets into your database.
Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

1-Summary of active vs closed accounts.
Active Accounts:
•In active accounts, there will be missing column "closed date" while in closed account,closed date column will be listed there.
•The number of active accounts is represented by the variable "X".
•These are accounts that are currently operational and being used by user till now.
Closed Accounts:
•IN case of closed account, account_balance column "closed date" is mentioned there.

•The number of active accounts is represented by the variable "Y";
•These are accounts that have been terminated or are no longer in use.

2- Breakdown of account_types (e.g.,loans,credit cards) and their current balances.
SELECT
    tl.sactioned_amount,
    tl.account_balance,
    tl.highest_credit,
    tl.account_category
FROM
    "TRANSACTION_LINE" tl
GROUP BY
    tl.account_category,1,2,3;
3- Analysis of loan amounts vs account balances.
•Loan Amount is always greater than account balance for every  in account ,if that account doesn't have already some amount. 
•Analysis through loan amounts vs account balance-
SELECT 
MAX(CASE WHEN ownership_type='Joint Account' AND account_category='Two-Wheeler Loan' THEN sactioned_amount-account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Joint_account_two_wheeler_loan,
  MAX(CASE WHEN ownership_type = 'Individual' AND account_category = 'Gold Loan' THEN sactioned_amount - account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Individual_Gold_Loan,
    MAX(CASE WHEN account_category = 'Credit Card' THEN sactioned_amount - account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Credit_Card,
    MAX(CASE WHEN account_category = 'Personal Loan' THEN sactioned_amount - account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Personal_Loan,
    MAX(CASE WHEN account_category = 'Housing Loan' THEN sactioned_amount - account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Housing_Loan,
    MAX(CASE WHEN account_category = 'Auto Loan' THEN sactioned_amount - account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Auto_Loan,
    MAX(CASE WHEN account_category = 'Consumer Loan' THEN sactioned_amount - account_balance ELSE NULL END) AS Consumer_Loan
FROM "TRANSACTION_LINE"; 
 Output:-->

4-Overview of the closure percentages for different loan types by ownership type (Individual vs Join Account) :
• Indivisual Ownership:
An individual owner holds the loan independently .
Closure percentages: The closure percentage for individual loans depend on various factors such as creditworthiness,loan terms, and market conditions
.Generally, individual loans have a diverse range of closure rates based on the borrower's financial situation ans external factors.
• Joint Ownership: 
Joint owners share ownership of the loan.
closure percentages: Joint accounts can be either beneficial or challenging.Here are some considerations:
  •Beneficial Aspects:
    •Additional FDIC Insurance: Joint accounts are FDIC insured for up to $250,000 per account owner. With two owners, the coverage extends to $500,000.
    •Shared Expenses: Couples or family members can use joint accounts to cover shared expenses or save for common goals.
    •Immediate Access: If one co-owner passes away, the surviving co-owner can access funds immediately.
Challenges:
    •Irrevocable: Typically, you cannot remove a co-owner once the joint account is established.
    •Credit Scores Matter: Lenders examine the credit scores of owners with 20% or more ownership when extending loans.
    •Risk of Compounded Credit Scores: Even if no single owner has low credit, the average credit score matters. Several owners with less-than-ideal scores may raise concerns.

Task 3: Creating required additional variables & Customer Segmentations
Create some additional variables and start doing segmentations based on different variables.
1- Let's start by segmenting customers based on FICO scores and account categories to see the distribution.
    •Objective: Segment customers based on their FICO scores and account categories.
    ⅰ•Understand the Data and Requirements:
     •FICO Score: A measure of a cusomter's crediworthiness.
     • Account categories: Types of accounts such as 'Credit Card','Personal Loan', etc
    ⅱ•Segment the Data:
     •Create Bins for FICO Scores: Define ranges or bins for different FICO score ranges.
     •Categorize Accounts: Use the existing account categories.
    ⅲ• Formulate the SQL Query:
     •Aggregate data based on FICO score ranges and account categories.
     •Use appropriate SQL functions to group and aggregate data.
-->Solution: 
SELECT 
 CASE 
 WHEN fico_score>= '300' AND fico_score<'579' THEN 'Poor'
 WHEN fico_score>= '580' AND fico_score<'669' THEN 'Fair'
 WHEN fico_score>= '670' AND fico_score<'793' THEN 'Good'
 WHEN fico_score>='740' AND fico_score<'799' THEN 'Very Good'
 WHEN fico_score>='800' AND fico_Score<'850' THEN 'Excellent' ELSE 'Unknown'
 END AS fico_score_category,account_category,
 count(*) AS num_customers FROM "TRANSACTION_LINE" tl 
 GROUP BY fico_score_category,account_category
 ORDER BY fico_score_category, account_category; 
2•Product Usage Segmentation:Categorizing customers by the types of accounts they hold (e.g.,Auto 
Loans,Credit Cards, etc.).
Solution :
• To categorize the customers by the types of accounts they hold , 
SELECT 
    tl.account_category AS loan_type,
    COUNT(*) AS quantity,
    tl.customer_id,
    CONCAT(ud.FIRST_NAME, ' ', ud.LAST_NAME) AS name
FROM 
    "TRANSACTION_LINE" tl
JOIN 
    user_data ud 
    ON ud.CUSTOMER_ID = tl.customer_id 
    tl.account_category,
    tl.customer_id,
    ud.FIRST_NAME,
    ud.LAST_NAME;
